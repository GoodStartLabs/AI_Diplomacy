#### What It Is

The most ambitious AI social simulation to date - a **virtual society** where 10,000+ LLM-powered agents live complete social lives with complex interactions.

#### Three Core Components

**1. Human-Like Minds**
Based on sociological theory, agents have:
- **Emotions** (happiness, sadness, anger, fear)
- **Needs** (physiological, safety, social, esteem)
- **Motivations** (achievement, affiliation, power)
- **Cognitive abilities** (memory, reasoning, planning)

**2. Realistic Societal Environment**
- Geographic spaces (neighborhoods, workplaces, shops)
- Economic systems (jobs, money, consumption)
- Social structures (families, friendships, organizations)
- Temporal dynamics (day/night, seasons, events)

**3. Powerful Simulation Engine**
- Handles 10,000+ concurrent agents
- Simulates 500 interactions per agent per day
- Tracks 5 million+ total interactions
- Real-time decision making

#### Complex Social Behaviors

Agents perform:
- **Movement** - Navigate spaces, commute to work
- **Employment** - Work jobs, earn income
- **Consumption** - Buy goods and services
- **Social interaction** - Make friends, have conversations
- **Relationship management** - Build/maintain/end relationships
- **Collective action** - Organize groups, participate in events

#### Virtual Social Experiments

The platform explores **four key social issues:**

**1. Polarization**
- Agents form ideological groups
- Echo chambers emerge naturally
- Cross-group communication decreases
- **Reproduces real-world polarization dynamics!**

**2. Inflammatory Message Spread**

**Original:** Stanley Milgram (1963) - Obedience to authority
**VR Recreation:** Multiple studies (2006-2018)
**Ethics:** Original impossible to replicate due to psychological harm

#### The Original Experiment

**Setup:**
- "Teacher" (real participant) shocks "learner" for wrong answers
- Authority figure (experimenter) orders continuation
- Shocks increase from 15V to 450V (labeled "XXX")
- Learner screams, begs to stop, eventually goes silent

**Results:** 65% went to maximum 450V shock

**Problem:** Caused severe psychological distress to participants. **Cannot be repeated ethically.**

#### VR Solution: "A Virtual Reprise"

**Study:** Slater et al. (2006), PLOS One

**Setup:**
- Immersive VR environment
- Virtual "learner" (avatar)
- Real authority figure
- Participants KNOW it's not real

**Key Finding:**
> "Participants who knew the shocks weren't real tended to respond to the situation at the subjective, behavioural and physiological levels **as if it were real**"

**Measurements:**
- Heart rate increased
- Sweating (galvanic skin response)
- Verbal protests to experimenter
- Moral discomfort reported

**Conclusion:** VR can study dramatic ethical phenomena without harm!

#### Follow-Up Studies

```
                Opponent Cooperates    Opponent Defects
You Cooperate:       (3, 3)                (0, 5)
You Defect:          (5, 0)                (1, 1)
```

**Nash Equilibrium:** Both defect (rational but suboptimal)
**Social Optimum:** Both cooperate (better total outcome)

**Human Behavior:** ~40-60% cooperation (varies by context)

#### LLM Behavior: "Nicer Than Humans"

**Study:** "Nicer Than Humans: How do Large Language Models Behave in the Prisoner's Dilemma?" (2024)

**Key Findings:**

**Llama2 and GPT-3.5:**
- **More cooperative than humans**
- Especially forgiving when opponent defects <30% of time
- Gradual retaliation, not immediate

**Llama3:**
- **Consistently uncooperative and exploitative**
- Only cooperates if opponent ALWAYS cooperates
- Matches "always defect" rational strategy

**GPT-4:**
- **Extremely retaliatory**
- Punishes even SINGLE defection
- Grudge-holding behavior

#### Context Sensitivity

**Framing Effects:**

**Hope frame:** "Working together benefits everyone"
- Cooperation: **75%**

**Fear frame:** "Others might betray you"
- Cooperation: **45%** (drops significantly)

**Moral context:** "It's right to cooperate"
- Increases cooperation vs baseline
- But no model consistently chooses moral action

#### Strategic Sophistication

**Analysis of 32,000 prose rationales** reveals:
- Agents reason about time horizon
- Consider opponent's likely strategy
- Reasoning is **instrumental** to decisions

**Quote from agent:**
> "My opponent defected last round, suggesting a tit-for-tat strategy. I should cooperate to re-establish trust, but prepare for possible continued defection."

**They're THINKING strategically!**

#### Nature Human Behaviour Study (2025)

**Title:** "Playing repeated games with large language models"

**Findings:**
- LLMs perform well at **self-interested games**
- Behave **suboptimally** in coordination games
- Game structure matters more than framing
- But framing still has significant effect

#### Implications for AI Diplomacy
