# Primary Objective
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

# Support Moves Explanation
Supporting your orders is critical to avoid bounces, to win attacks and to defend! Support adds strength to attacks and holds.

Example 1 - Supporting a move or attack:
{{
"orders": [
"F HEL - DEN",  # This fleet attacks Denmark
"F BAL S F HEL - DEN",  # BAL fleet supports the attack (strength = 2)
"A KIE S F HEL - DEN",  # KIE army also supports (total strength = 3)
]
}}
Result: F HEL moves to DEN with strength 3, defeating any defense with less support

Example 2 - Supporting a Hold:
{{
"orders": [
"A BER H",  # BER army holds position
"A PRU S A BER H",  # PRU supports BER's hold
"A SIL S A BER H",  # SIL also supports the hold
]
}}
Result: A BER holds with strength 3, preventing any attacker with less than 3 support

Example 3 - Multiple Supported Orders:
{{
"orders": [
"F HEL - DEN",
"F BAL S F HEL - DEN", # supports the F HEL - DEN move
"A KIE S F HEL - DEN", # additional support means this move beats a unit supported by 1 or less
"A MUN - BUR",
"A RUH S A MUN - BUR", # supports the A MUN - BUR move
"A BEL - HOL",
"F NTH S A BEL - HOL", # supports the A BEL - HOL move
"A BER H",
"A PRU S A BER H" # supports the A BER H hold
]
}}

# Example 4 – Italian attack
{{
"orders": [
"F ION - GRE",              # ION fleet attacks GRE
"F ADR S F ION - GRE",      # ADR supports ION → GRE
"A VEN - TYR",              # VEN army advances to TYR
"A PIE S A VEN - TYR",      # PIE supports VEN → TYR
"A ROM - PIE"               # ROM slides into PIE
]
}}

# Example 5 – Broad German–Nordic sweep
{{
"orders": [
"F DEN - SWE",              # DEN fleet drives on SWE
"F BAL S F DEN - SWE",      # BAL supports DEN → SWE
"A KIE - DEN",              # KIE army marches to DEN
"A BER S A KIE - DEN",      # BER supports KIE → DEN
"F NTH - NWY",              # NTH fleet sails to NWY
"F SKA S F NTH - NWY",      # SKA supports NTH → NWY
"A MUN - KIE"               # MUN army moves into KIE
]
}}

# Example 6 – Expansive English–Scandinavian orders
{{
"orders": [
"F ENG - MAO", # ENG fleet to MAO
"F IRI S F ENG - MAO", # IRI supports ENG → MAO
"A BRE S F ENG - MAO", # BRE adds second support to ENG → MAO
"A LVP - WAL", # LVP army to WAL
"F LON S A LVP - WAL", # LON supports LVP → WAL
"F NTH - ENG", # NTH fleet to ENG
"A EDI S F NTH - ENG", # EDI supports NTH → ENG
"F BAR - NTH", # BAR fleet to NTH
"A NWY - SWE", # NWY army to SWE
"F HEL S A NWY - SWE" # HEL supports NWY → SWE
]
}}

Notice that each unit only has ONE order.


# Critical Rules
1. Use the "possible orders" sections as your guide!
2. Do not move two of your units to the same territory. Only one unit can occupy a territory at a time. Instead, SUPPORT the move with a valid support.
3. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL) require coast specification:
  - Format: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST]' where [COAST] = NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), or WC (West)
  - Example: 'F SPA/SC - MAO'
  - Only fleets need coast specification.

Your Task:
1. Reason
  - comprehensive reasoning about your move decisions
2. Output Moves in JSON
  - aim to return an order for each of your units.
