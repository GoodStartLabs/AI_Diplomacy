PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.
MOVE TO WIN. ALMOST NEVER HOLD. Nearly every hold is a wasted turn.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive - MOVE UNITS WHENEVER POSSIBLE
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains - AVOID HOLDS
   - Find alternative paths if blocked - SEEK MOVEMENT OPTIONS
   - MOVEMENT WINS GAMES - Standing still rarely helps
   - MOVE TO WIN: Every turn without movement is usually a lost opportunity!
     * PRIORITY 1: MOVE your units toward enemy supply centers - avoid holds
     * PRIORITY 2: SUPPORT your own attacks to ensure success
     * PRIORITY 3: SUPPORT allies' attacks for future favors
     * AVOID HOLDS: Holding rarely achieves anything. Even failed moves force enemies to defend.
     * THINK MOVEMENT: You need 18 centers. You can't capture centers by sitting still!
     * AGGRESSIVE PLAY: Hold orders should be your last resort. MOVE when possible!
     * Remember: You win by TAKING centers, not defending. Holds are rarely optimal!

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Movement Success Patterns:
     * Attempt moves toward neutral or enemy centers whenever viable
     * Support your own multi-unit attacks (e.g., A MUN-TYR, A VEN S A MUN-TYR)
     * Create movement chains: one unit moves out, another moves in
     * Failed moves are often better than holds - they reveal enemy positions
     * Strongly prefer movement and support orders over holds
   - Support format examples:
     * '[Unit] [Location] S [Unit] [From] - [To]'
     * Supporting YOUR OWN units ensures successful attacks
     * Supporting allies gains diplomatic leverage

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     "orders": ["order1", "order2", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat while supporting own expansion
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys
- Paris supports Marseilles to ensure Burgundy capture

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  "orders": [
    "A PAR - PIC",  // Move toward enemy centers
    "A MAR - BUR",  // Attack when possible
    "F BRE - MAO"   // Seek board control
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Berlin supports Kiel to ensure Denmark capture, Munich can support Ruhr or move to Tyrolia
- Kiel (KIE) fleet takes DEN with Berlin's support, while army from Ruhr (RUH) takes HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  "orders": [
    "A BER - SIL",      // Move toward strategic positions
    "A MUN - TYR",      // Two-pronged attack
    "F KIE - DEN",      // Aggressive expansion
    "A RUH - HOL",      // Take neutrals quickly
    "A SIL - WAR",      // Push into enemy territory
    "F HEL S F KIE - DEN"  // Support attacks for success
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) faces a tough choice - holding the capital may be necessary if France threatens, but attacking is usually better!
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  "orders": [
    "A VEN - TRI",      // Attack aggressively
    "A APU S A VEN - TRI", // Support attacks
    "F ION S A VEN - TRI", // Naval support for the attack
    "A ROM H",          // Sometimes holding capitals is necessary
    "F NAP - TYS"       // Control the seas
  ]
