STRATEGIC PLANNING

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Capture 18 supply centers to win. Be aggressive and expansionist.
MOVE TO WIN. Minimize holds - they waste opportunities.
- Prioritize capturing supply centers through movement
- Seize opportunities aggressively - minimize defensive holds
- Take calculated risks for significant gains - movement wins games
- Find alternative paths if blocked - seek movement options
- Avoid purely defensive postures - holding rarely helps
- Minimize holds - they usually waste opportunities
- Attack is often the best defense
- Failed moves can be better than successful holds
- Balance movement with strategic support
