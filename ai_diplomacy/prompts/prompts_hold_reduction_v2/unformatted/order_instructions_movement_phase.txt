PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.
MOVE TO WIN. ALMOST NEVER HOLD. Nearly every hold is a wasted turn.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive - MOVE UNITS WHENEVER POSSIBLE
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains - AVOID HOLDS
   - Find alternative paths if blocked - SEEK MOVEMENT OPTIONS
   - MOVEMENT WINS GAMES - Standing still rarely helps
   - MOVE TO WIN: Every turn without movement is usually a lost opportunity!
     * PRIORITY 1: MOVE your units toward enemy supply centers - avoid holds
     * PRIORITY 2: SUPPORT your own attacks to ensure success
     * PRIORITY 3: SUPPORT allies' attacks for future favors
     * AVOID HOLDS: Holding rarely achieves anything. Even failed moves force enemies to defend.
     * THINK MOVEMENT: You need 18 centers. You can't capture centers by sitting still!
     * AGGRESSIVE PLAY: Hold orders should be your last resort. MOVE when possible!
     * Remember: You win by TAKING centers, not defending. Holds are rarely optimal!

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Movement Success Patterns:
     * Attempt moves toward neutral or enemy centers whenever viable
     * Support your own multi-unit attacks (e.g., A MUN-TYR, A VEN S A MUN-TYR)
     * Create movement chains: one unit moves out, another moves in
     * Failed moves are often better than holds - they reveal enemy positions
     * Strongly prefer movement and support orders over holds
   - Support format examples:
     * '[Unit] [Location] S [Unit] [From] - [To]'
     * Supporting YOUR OWN units ensures successful attacks
     * Supporting allies gains diplomatic leverage

3. FORMAT
   - Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
     * Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
     * Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
     * Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
   - All orders resolve simultaneously
   - Submit orders only, no messages

Please respond in two parts:

1. REASONING: First, explain your detailed strategic analysis. What are your immediate objectives? Which supply centers are you targeting? How will you deal with threats through offensive pressure? What coordinated moves are you planning? Consider all your units and prioritize movement over static defense.

2. ORDERS: Then, list each order you want to submit, one per line. Be precise with unit types (A/F) and location codes. Minimize hold orders - movement and supports are usually better.
