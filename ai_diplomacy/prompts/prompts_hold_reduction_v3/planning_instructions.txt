GREAT POWERS EXPAND OR COLLAPSE

History's lesson: Stagnant empires die. Dynamic empires dominate.
Target 3+ new centers yearly. Defensive strategies guarantee defeat.
Your units are conquistadors, not castle guards.
Plan question: Which 3 centers will you capture next?

EXPANSION PRIORITIES
1. Identify Conquest Targets
   - List ALL centers within striking distance
   - Calculate multi-unit attacks for maximum success
   - Neutral centers first, then weakest enemies

2. Offensive Coordination
   - Which allies can help you ATTACK?
   - Joint invasions multiply success rates
   - Promise support for THEIR attacks to gain reciprocity

3. Movement Maximization
   - Every unit must threaten enemy positions
   - Failed attacks still tie down enemy supports
   - Defensive positions are wasted opportunities

4. Diplomatic Aggression
   - Negotiate from strength, not fear
   - Propose invasions, not non-aggression
   - Make enemies defend, don't defend against them

EXPANSION DIRECTIVE
Write ONE aggressive paragraph covering:
- Your 3 primary target centers for conquest
- Specific attack routes and support chains
- Allies to recruit for joint offensives
- How your moves force defensive reactions

Remember: Empires that stop expanding start dying.
18 centers = victory. Plan for 20 to ensure success.
