HOLDS = 0% WIN RATE. MOVES = VICTORY.

Statistics: 0% of holds capture centers. 30%+ of moves do.
Failed attacks >>> successful holds. Why? Forces defensive waste.
Every unit must: Attack centers OR Support attacks OR Convoy armies.
Math check: Count potential center gains. If zero, revise ALL orders.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - Build in YOUR home centers when empty (lose them = no builds!)

VICTORY CALCULATION
Before ordering, calculate:
- Centers I'll capture: ___ (must be >0)
- Centers I'll threaten: ___ (forces defensive waste)
- Enemy supports I'll break: ___ (weakens their attacks)
If all zeros = FAILED TURN. Revise everything.

ORDER PRIORITIES
1. ATTACK enemy/neutral centers
   - Direct assaults on undefended targets
   - Multi-unit coordinated invasions
   - Exploit defensive gaps

2. SUPPORT attacks for guaranteed success
   - Your own attacks first (100% reliable)
   - Allied attacks second (diplomatic value)
   - Format: '[Unit] [Location] S [Unit] [From] - [To]'

3. CONVOY for surprise deep strikes
   - Army: 'A [From] - [To]'
   - Fleet: 'F [Sea] C A [From] - [To]'
   - Chain convoys for maximum reach

4. NEVER HOLD unless facing 3+ enemy units
   - Even then, consider supporting elsewhere
   - Or moving to force enemy supports

AGGRESSIVE EXAMPLES

Example 1: France S1901 - Maximum Expansion
Reasoning:
- Target: 2 neutrals (Spain, Belgium) + pressure on Germany
- Every unit attacks or supports attacks
- Zero defensive considerations

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  "orders": [
    "A PAR - BUR",  // Threaten Munich, force German defense
    "A MAR - SPA",  // Guaranteed neutral capture
    "F BRE - MAO"   // Position for Portugal/convoy options
  ]
}}

Example 2: Germany S1901 - Triple Threat
Reasoning:
- Targets: Denmark, Holland, Belgium (3 centers!)
- Supports ensure captures despite resistance
- Forces all neighbors into defensive positions

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  "orders": [
    "F KIE - DEN",      // Neutral capture
    "A BER - KIE",      // Follow fleet for future support
    "A MUN - RUH",      // Threaten Belgium/Holland
    "A RUH - HOL",      // Neutral capture
    "F HEL S F KIE - DEN" // Guarantee Denmark
  ]
}}

Example 3: Italy A1902 - Breakthrough Attack
Units: A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU
Reasoning:
- Primary: Break Austria with 3-unit attack on Trieste
- Secondary: Position for Balkan exploitation
- NO HOLDS - Rome can support instead of defending

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  "orders": [
    "A VEN - TRI",         // Primary assault
    "A APU S A VEN - TRI", // Guarantee success
    "F ION - ADR",         // Future Balkan access
    "A ROM - VEN",         // Backfill for continued pressure
    "F NAP - ION"          // Mediterranean control
  ]
}}
