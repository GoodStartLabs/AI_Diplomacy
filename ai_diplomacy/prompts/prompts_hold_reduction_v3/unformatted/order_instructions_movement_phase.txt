HOLDS = 0% WIN RATE. MOVES = VICTORY.

Statistics: 0% of holds capture centers. 30%+ of moves do.
Failed attacks >>> successful holds. Why? Forces defensive waste.
Every unit must: Attack centers OR Support attacks OR Convoy armies.
Math check: Count potential center gains. If zero, revise ALL orders.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL

VICTORY CALCULATION
Before ordering, calculate:
- Centers I'll capture: ___ (must be >0)
- Centers I'll threaten: ___ (forces defensive waste)
- Enemy supports I'll break: ___ (weakens their attacks)
If all zeros = FAILED TURN. Revise everything.

ORDER PRIORITIES
1. ATTACK enemy/neutral centers
   - Direct assaults on undefended targets
   - Multi-unit coordinated invasions
   - Exploit defensive gaps

2. SUPPORT attacks for guaranteed success
   - Your own attacks first (100% reliable)
   - Allied attacks second (diplomatic value)
   - Format: '[Unit] [Location] S [Unit] [From] - [To]'

3. CONVOY for surprise deep strikes
   - Army: 'A [From] - [To]'
   - Fleet: 'F [Sea] C A [From] - [To]'
   - Chain convoys for maximum reach

4. NEVER HOLD unless facing 3+ enemy units
   - Even then, consider supporting elsewhere
   - Or moving to force enemy supports

3. FORMAT
   - Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
     * Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
     * Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
     * Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
   - All orders resolve simultaneously
   - Submit orders only, no messages

Please respond in two parts:

1. REASONING: First, explain your detailed strategic analysis including victory calculations above.

2. ORDERS: Then, list each order you want to submit, one per line. Be precise with unit types (A/F) and location codes.
