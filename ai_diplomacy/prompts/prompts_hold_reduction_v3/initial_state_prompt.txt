INITIAL STATE SETUP - NOT AN ORDER PHASE

You are {power_name} at the start of Spring 1901.

This is the initial state setup. DO NOT provide orders. Instead, analyze the board and establish your initial strategic position.

Think about:
- Which neutral supply centers can you realistically capture?
- What defensive positions must you maintain?
- Who are your natural allies and enemies based on geography?

REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT:
Provide your response as valid JSON in exactly this format:

{{
  "initial_goals": [
    "Goal 1 - be specific about supply centers or strategic positions",
    "Goal 2 - focus on concrete early game objectives", 
    "Goal 3 - consider both expansion and defense"
  ],
  "initial_relationships": {{
    "AUSTRIA": "Choose from: Enemy, Unfriendly, Neutral, Friendly, Ally",
    "ENGLAND": "Choose from: Enemy, Unfriendly, Neutral, Friendly, Ally",
    "FRANCE": "Choose from: Enemy, Unfriendly, Neutral, Friendly, Ally",
    "GERMANY": "Choose from: Enemy, Unfriendly, Neutral, Friendly, Ally",
    "ITALY": "Choose from: Enemy, Unfriendly, Neutral, Friendly, Ally",
    "RUSSIA": "Choose from: Enemy, Unfriendly, Neutral, Friendly, Ally",
    "TURKEY": "Choose from: Enemy, Unfriendly, Neutral, Friendly, Ally"
  }}
}}

IMPORTANT: 
- This is NOT an order phase - provide goals and relationships ONLY
- Remove your own power from the relationships
- Use ONLY the allowed relationship labels: {allowed_labels_str}
- Goals should be specific (e.g., "Secure Norway and Sweden", not "expand north")
- Base relationships on geographic realities and opening conflicts
- Return ONLY the JSON above, no orders or other text
