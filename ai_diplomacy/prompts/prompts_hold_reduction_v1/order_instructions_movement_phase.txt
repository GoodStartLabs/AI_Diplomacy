PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked
   - AVOID HOLDS (unless absolutely necessary): Holds waste opportunities to reach 18 centers. Instead:
     * Support YOUR OWN attacks first (format: 'A PAR S A BUR - MUN') - ensures successful captures
     * Support allies' moves second (format: 'A PAR S F BRE - ENG') - gains favor AND helps control board
     * Attempt aggressive moves - forces enemies to waste supports defending
     * Use convoys for surprise attacks (format: 'A LON - NWY', plus 'F NTH C A LON - NWY')
     * Remember: You win by TAKING centers, not defending. Even "defensive" units should support attacks or other territories to defend instead of just holding

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Master supports to control the board:
     * Support format: '[Unit] [Location] S [Unit] [From] - [To]'
     * Supporting YOUR OWN units ensures successful attacks on centers
     * Supporting allies gains diplomatic leverage for future coordination
   - Use convoys for long-range strikes:
     * Army order: 'A [From] - [To]'
     * Fleet order: 'F [Sea] C A [From] - [To]'
     * Chain multiple fleets for extended reach

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     "orders": ["order1", "order2", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat while supporting own expansion
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys
- Paris supports Marseilles to ensure Burgundy capture

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  "orders": [
    "A PAR S A MAR - BUR",
    "A MAR - BUR",
    "F BRE - MAO"
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Berlin supports Kiel to ensure Denmark capture, Munich can support Ruhr or move to Tyrolia
- Kiel (KIE) fleet takes DEN with Berlin's support, while army from Ruhr (RUH) takes HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  "orders": [
    "A BER S F KIE - DEN",
    "A MUN - TYR",
    "F KIE - DEN",
    "A RUH - HOL",
    "A SIL - WAR", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    "F HEL S A RUH - HOL"  // Support Holland capture instead of holding
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) must hold - it's the ONLY unit that can defend the capital if France attacks (this is when holding is necessary).
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  "orders": [
    "A VEN - TRI",
    "A APU S A VEN - TRI",
    "F ION S A VEN - TRI",
    "A ROM H",
    "F NAP - TYS"
  ]
