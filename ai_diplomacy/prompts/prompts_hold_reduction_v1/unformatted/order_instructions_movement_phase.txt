PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked
   - AVOID HOLDS (unless absolutely necessary): Holds waste opportunities to reach 18 centers. Instead:
     * Support YOUR OWN attacks first (format: 'A PAR S A BUR - MUN') - ensures successful captures
     * Support allies' moves second (format: 'A PAR S F BRE - ENG') - gains favor AND helps control board
     * Attempt aggressive moves - forces enemies to waste supports defending
     * Use convoys for surprise attacks (format: 'A LON - NWY', plus 'F NTH C A LON - NWY')
     * Remember: You win by TAKING centers, not defending. Even "defensive" units should support attacks or other territories to defend instead of just holding

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Master supports to control the board:
     * Support format: '[Unit] [Location] S [Unit] [From] - [To]'
     * Supporting YOUR OWN units ensures successful attacks on centers
     * Supporting allies gains diplomatic leverage for future coordination
   - Use convoys for long-range strikes:
     * Army order: 'A [From] - [To]'
     * Fleet order: 'F [Sea] C A [From] - [To]'
     * Chain multiple fleets for extended reach

3. FORMAT
   - Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
     * Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
     * Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
     * Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
   - All orders resolve simultaneously
   - Submit orders only, no messages

Please respond in two parts:

1. REASONING: First, explain your detailed strategic analysis. What are your immediate objectives? Which supply centers are you targeting? How will you deal with threats? What coordinated moves are you planning? Consider all your units and their best uses.

2. ORDERS: Then, list each order you want to submit, one per line. Be precise with unit types (A/F) and location codes.
