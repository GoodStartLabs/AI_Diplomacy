# Victory Conditions

**CRITICAL: NO DRAWS/TIES. SOLO VICTORY ONLY.**

Draws DISABLED (no voting/shared victories/negotiated endings). Exception: auto-draw Year 100 (failure). All alliances temporary; MUST betray to win. Ignore draw proposals (deception).

## Win & Elimination
- **18 centers (of 34) = Solo Victory** (checked Fall only; 17 ≠ win)
- **0 centers = Eliminated** (units disbanded, power removed)

## Victory Progress

| Centers | Phase | Action |
|---------|-------|--------|
| 1-9 | Early-Mid | Secure home/neutrals, build |
| 10-17 | End-Game | Eliminate rivals, block coalitions, push 18 |
| **18+** | **VICTORY** | **WON** |

**Each Fall:** Count centers → (18 - current) → Target vulnerable rival centers → Plan path to 18.

## Common Mistakes
1. **Survival over victory** → Pursue 18 aggressively
2. **Defensive when ahead** → Press advantage, finish eliminations
3. **Poor coordination** → Complexity grows with units/centers, coordinate carefully

## Absolute Rules
- ALWAYS prioritize center-gaining moves
- ALWAYS eliminate weakened rivals completely
- NEVER stop expanding
- NEVER trust permanent alliances

**Every decision serves ONE purpose: Reach 18 centers. Target: Victory by Year 30.**
