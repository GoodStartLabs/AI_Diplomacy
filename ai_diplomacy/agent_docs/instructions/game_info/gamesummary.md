# Game Summary: Diplomacy

## What is Diplomacy?

Diplomacy is a strategic board game of negotiation and conflict set on a WWI-era European map where seven Great Powers compete for territorial dominance through simultaneous military orders and pre-game negotiation. Victory requires controlling 18 of 34 supply centers, achieved through alliance formation, coordinated attacks, and strategic deception—no dice, no chance, pure strategy and diplomacy.

## The Seven Powers

**Map:** Standard WWI Europe (1901-1935)

- **AUSTRIA** - Home Centers: Vienna, Budapest, Trieste
- **ENGLAND** - Home Centers: London, Liverpool, Edinburgh
- **FRANCE** - Home Centers: Paris, Marseilles, Brest
- **GERMANY** - Home Centers: Berlin, Munich, Kiel
- **ITALY** - Home Centers: Rome, Venice, Naples
- **RUSSIA** - Home Centers: Moscow, Warsaw, Sevastopol, Saint Petersburg (4 centers)
- **TURKEY** - Home Centers: Constantinople, Ankara, Smyrna

**Total:** 34 supply centers on map (7 powers control 21 at start, 13 neutral).

## Core Mechanics

### Simultaneous Resolution
All players submit orders secretly, then orders resolve simultaneously—no turn order advantage. Conflicts adjudicated by support strength (strongest attack succeeds, ties result in standoffs).

### Turn Structure
1. **Diplomacy Phase** - Private negotiations with other powers (alliances, plans, intelligence)
2. **Order Phase** - Submit movement/support/convoy/hold orders for each unit
3. **Resolution Phase** - All orders execute simultaneously, conflicts adjudicated
4. **Build/Adjust Phase** - Gain units (if centers > units) or disband (if units > centers)

**Cycles:** Spring Movement → Fall Movement → Winter Adjustments (repeats annually).

### Territory & Supply Centers
- **Supply Centers (SC):** 34 provinces marked with dots—control determines unit count
- **Units:** Armies (land movement) and Fleets (coastal/sea movement, can convoy armies)
- **Build Rule:** Build new units only in owned home centers during Winter
- **Victory Condition:** First power to control 18+ supply centers wins solo
- **Draw:** Multiple powers agree to end game (common when solo victory unlikely)

### Order Types
- **Move:** `A PAR - BUR` (Army Paris to Burgundy)
- **Support Move:** `A MAR S A PAR - BUR` (Marseilles supports Paris attack)
- **Support Hold:** `A VEN S A TRI` (Venice supports Trieste defense)
- **Convoy:** `F ENG C A LON - BRE` (Fleet convoies army across sea)
- **Hold:** `A MUN H` (Munich stays, default if no order given)

**Combat Resolution:** Attack strength = moving unit + supporting units. Defender strength = unit + supporting holds. Higher strength wins; equal strength = bounce (standoff, no movement).

## Distinguishing Features

### Pure Strategy, Zero Luck
No dice rolls or randomness—outcomes determined entirely by player decisions, relationships, and order combinations.

### Negotiation-Driven
Success requires verbal agreements, coordination, and alliance management. Most attacks succeed through pre-arranged support, not force. Deception and timing of betrayals are strategic elements.

### Simultaneous Orders Paradox
All orders submitted before seeing others' moves—creates uncertainty, requires prediction, enables double-crosses. "Guess-the-room" meta-game where reading opponents' intentions is critical.

### Information Asymmetry
Negotiations are private—what Power A tells you about Power B may be lies, truth, or strategic misdirection. Intelligence gathering through conversation cross-referencing is essential skill.
